 greece.29.d:0 " The Greek foreign minister has met with our President demanding of a treaty be signed in which multiple regions such as Izmir, Izmit, Instabul and others be ceded to its' 'rightful owner', obviously they can't be taken serious.

 GRE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 ""For Greece the Great War did not end in 1918. The disastrous war with Turkey and the terrible effects of the National Schism have left many wounds open for the Greek nation. The Great Depression, unemployment, social and political instability and the rise of radicalism have brought the small country of Greece before a crossroad to decide its own future, overcome the many problems and look ahead as their legacy calls.""
