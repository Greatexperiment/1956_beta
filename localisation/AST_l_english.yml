 r56_australia.1.d:0 "Isaac Isaacs' term as Governor-General is over. He will be remembered as the first Australian Governor-General and for his great frugality while in office.\n\nOf the candidates recommended to replace him, the Prime Minister has decided that to return to a British Governor-General and has offered the position to Alexander Hore-Ruthven.\n\nHe was previously the Governor of New South Wales and of South Australia before that where he used his influence to help the state during the start of the Great Depression. "

 r56_australia.2.d:0 "Alexander Hore-Ruthven's term as Governor-General is over. The King has granted him the title of Earl of Gowrie in recognition to his service with the new job of Deputy Constable and Lieutenant-Governor of Windsor Castle.

 r56_australia.4.t:0 "The Death of Joseph Lyons"
 r56_australia.4.uap:0 "Prime Minister Joseph Lyons has suffered a heart attack while being driven from Melbourne to Sydney. He was collecting his son from college at the time. As the first Prime Minister to die in office, there is no constitutional precedent as to who should be appointed as his successor. The lack of a deputy leader for the UAP has complicated matters and it will be some time before a new leader of the UAP can be chosen. Earle Page, leader of the Country Party and deputy Prime Minister has been chose to serve as interim Prime Minister until the UAP are able to vote on their new leader.\n\nAt the age of 59, Lyons was complementing his retirement and wished to spend more time with his young children, however the lack of successor lead to the party pressuring him to stay. Lyons will be remembered for keeping the country together as it struggled from the Great Depression."
 r56_australia.4.labor:0 "Former Prime Minister Joseph Lyons has suffered a heart attack while collecting his son from college.

In an act that has shocked Parliament, Interim Prime Minister Earle Page has refused to serve under Menzies and in the House made an extraordinary attack upon Menzies, accusing him of incompetence and cowardice for failing to enlist during the Great War. The Country Party was quick to respond and ousted Page as its leader.\n\nHowever you look at it, it is a sour way to begin your premiership."
