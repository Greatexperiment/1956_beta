r56_guerilla_warfare_desc:0 "We need to greatly change how our arm forces operate. The fact of the matter is that the armies that we’d possibly go to war with greatly outmatch us. We need to adopt an asymmetrical approach to warfare if we ever hope to stand a chance."
r56_double_envelopment:0 "Sudden Envelopment"
r56_double_envelopment_desc:0 "The envelopment as a military tactic as old as warfare it’s self. We can utilize this tactic in places the enemy overextends its forces and where we have superior knowledge of the terrain. We can then quickly envelop a small number of enemy troops and destroy them before the enemy can aid the trapped troops. We can repeat this process to cut up large enemy forces into more manageable forces."
